# Milieu-API
The API documentation

## Usage
1. Install the Swagger UI plugin for chrome
2. Open any api file in the repo
3. Click the swagger plugin
4. Read the API doc from Swagger UI

## Generate Code? Generate Doc?
In theory, you can either generate API code from API doc, or generate API doc from your code if you
find a great framework. I didn't investigate too much time on these two. Both way will reduce your
burden to create APIs.

The API docs are manually generated by typing for now. The main purpose is to improve the team
cooperation when craft and use the APIs. Anyone is welcome to automate this process!

## Alternative
If you really don't like Swagger with whatever reasons, you may also check RAML as alternative.
